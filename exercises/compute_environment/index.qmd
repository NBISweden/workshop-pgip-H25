This page briefly describes different compute environments that may be
used for exercises. We use the following symbols to icons that
indicate the type of environment ({{< fa server >}} HPC resource; {{<
fa laptop >}} local compute environment; {{< fa brands firefox >}}
online browser-based resource). Make sure to read these instructions
before proceeding with the exercises.

## {{< fa server >}} Dardel @ PDC

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}

### Prerequisite: SUPR account

If you want to run the exercises on the Dardel HPC you need an
account. Follow the instructions at the [precourse
page](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-pgip/precourse.html#dardel-compute-resources).

:::

We will primarily be using KTH's high-performance computing (HPC)
center
[Dardel](https://www.pdc.kth.se/hpc-services/computing-systems/dardel-hpc-system/dardel-1.1043529)
to run exercises. Course material will be hosted in a dedicated course
project directory `{{< var pg_pgip_dir >}}`.

### Working directory setup

We recommend you setup a working directory based on your username in
`{{< var pg_pgip_dir >}}/users` in which to run your exercises:

```bash
mkdir -p {{< var pg_pgip_dir >}}/users/YOURUSERNAME
cd {{< var pg_pgip_dir >}}/users/YOURUSERNAME
```

### pixi environments and pgip CLI

:::{.callout-warning}

##### EXPERIMENTAL

This feature is experimental and may not work as intended.

:::

In order to improve reproducibility and facilitate package setup, we
have grouped exercise tools in [pixi virtual
environments]^[[pixi](https://pixi.sh) is a fast package management
tool, similar to [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda).]
Exercise environments are named `e-EXERCISE-NAME` and can be activated
with a custom command line (CLI) tool called `pgip`. To activate the
CLI, do the following steps:

```bash
source {{< var pg_pgip_dir >}}/init.sh
pgip_activate
```

Now you should have access to `pgip`, which among other things lets
you setup exercise data and launch notebooks. In addition, there are
two commands `pgip_elist` and `pgip_shell`. `pgip_elist` lists
available environments and `pgip_shell ENVIRONMENT_NAME` starts a
shell with the environment activated.

:::{.callout-important}

###### Run pgip_activate before pgip_shell

It is important that you run `pgip_activate` first as exiting would
terminate your session. Exiting from the shell will pop you back to
the activated default environment.

### ThinLinc {#sec-thinlinc}

KTH provides a remote desktop program called [ThinLinc] which lets you
connect to a remote server and access programs via a virtual desktop.
To use, you first need to download the ThinLinc client (tlclient). To
connect, launch tlclient and authenticate with either Kerberos or SSH.
See the PDC documentation for more documentation.

#### Launching graphical applications

The is a launcher located in the menu bar that should let you start
graphical applications. If that doesn't work, you can always

### Interactive jobs

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}

#### Please do not book more than {{< var naiss_max_cores >}} cores

We have priviliged access to a limited number of nodes. Please do not
book more than {{< var naiss_max_cores >}} cores or else your fellow
students will experience long waiting times.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

#### Make sure to login to a compute node before running any compute-intensive commands

:::

All computations should be run on a compute node. You can request an
[interactive
session](https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/run_jobs/run_interactively/)
with the `salloc` command. For example, to request an eight hour
job on {{< var naiss_max_cores >}} cores, run

```bash
salloc -A {{< var pdc_time_allocation >}} -n {{< var naiss_max_cores >}} \
   --time 08:00:00 \
   --reservation=<name of reservation> \
   --no-shell
```

where `<name of reservation>` needs to be replaced by the node
reservations, which will typically be unique for every day.

The `--no-shell` option will immediately exit the allocated node but
keep the Slurm job active. Make a note of the allocated node ID and
use `ssh` to access it.

```bash
ssh node_id
```

### Accessing notebooks on compute nodes

See [ThinLinc](#sec-thinlinc) for a potentially easier way to
access compute nodes and resources.

Notebooks are run in browser sessions, but if run on compute nodes
they are not directly accessible from the client. The trick is to set
up *double port forwarding*, in which a port is forwarded from the
compute node to the login node and on to your client. If you use the
`pgip` CLI to launch a notebook, it will look as follows:

```bash
pgip notebook jupyter --port 9999
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:notebook
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:Running jupyter lab  --no-browser --port=9999
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:Jupyter lab running at http://localhost:9999
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:To stop Jupyter Notebook, press Ctrl+C
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:For port forwarding to login node, on login node run:
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:ssh -L 9999:localhost:9999 nid002581 -N -f
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:For port forwarding to client localhost, on client run:
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:ssh -L 9999:localhost:9999 dardel.pdc.kth.se -N -f
INFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]:
```

Here, `NODEID` is the compute node id. To enable port forwarding, you
need to run the to `ssh -L ...` commands, and voil√†, you should be
able to access the notebook at `localhost:9999`.

:::{.callout-important}

##### The port id must be unique and in the recommended range 1024-49151

### Tutorials

PDC hosts tutorials and user guides at
<https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc>. In particular,
<https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/basics/quickstart> has information on
how to connect to and work on Dardel.

## {{< fa laptop >}} Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) exercises will be run in
local compute environments on your laptop. See the section below on
setting up a `pgip` environment with [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/),
which by default installs `jupyter` and its dependencies.

### {{< fa brands firefox >}} JupyterLite

There are some Jupyter Notebook exercises that are hosted online and
run using [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite)
which is a JupyterLab distribution that runs entirely in the browser.
Apart from having a browser, no preparations are necessary. Note that
some users have reported issues with Firefox and that Google Chrome
may be a better solution.

## {{< fa laptop >}} Pixi {#sec-compute-environment-pixi}

Exercises that require local software installation will make use of
the [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) package manager to install
necessary [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) requirements from
the package repositories [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/). This is also the fallback
solution in case there are issues with the HPC.

To start using pixi, follow the [install
instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) to install. You
can choose to run all exercises on a local computer if you have pixi
setup. You would then need to download relevant data, as detailed for
each exercise. We have tried to make the exercise data sets small such
that you can run the exercises locally.

## Tools

Computer exercise requirements are listed in `Tools` callout blocks in
each exercise. The `Tools` callout block contains listings of
programs, along with package dependencies and specifications for
Dardel and pixi, whenever relevant. An example block is shown below.

#### Listing

Provides list of packages linked to repository, and citation when
available.

- [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) [@li_AligningSequenceReads_2013]

#### {{< fa server >}} PDC

Choose **one** of **Modules** and **Virtual environment** to access
relevant tools.

##### Modules

Execute the following command to load modules:

```{bash }
#| label: pdc-load-modules
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
module load bwa/0.7.18 fastqc/0.12.1
```

##### Virtual environment

Run the `pgip` initialization script and activate the `pgip`
default environment:

```bash
source {{< var pg_pgip_dir >}}/init.sh
pgip_activate
```

Then activate the `<exercise environment>` environment:

```bash
# pgip_shell calls pixi shell -e <exercise environment> --as-is
pgip_shell <exercise environment>
```

#### {{< fa laptop >}} pixi

Provides a [pixi manifest
file](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/pixi_manifest/) that lists
dependencies and where to retrieve them.

Copy the contents to a file `pixi.toml` in directory `exercise-name`,
`cd` to directory and activate environment with `pixi shell`:

```{lang="text" }
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge", "bioconda"]
name = "exercise-name"
platforms = ["linux-64"]

[dependencies]
bwa = ">=0.7.19,<0.8"
fastqc = ">=0.12.1,<0.13"
```
