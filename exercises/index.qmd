## Information

All exercise pages start with a callout block that provides
information on how to setup the relevant [Compute
environment](compute_environment/index.qmd). The callout blocks are
labelled with icons that indicate the type of environment ({{< fa
server >}} PDC resource; {{< fa laptop >}} local compute environment;
{{< fa brands firefox >}} online browser-based resource). Make sure to
read these instructions before proceeding with the exercise itself.
Some of the documents include a link to an external URL that hosts the
actual exercise instructions.

#### {{< fa server >}} Compute environment setup

Before proceeding, make sure to read [Compute
environment](compute_environment/index.qmd) for information on how
to prepare your working directory.

## On self-assessment exercise blocks

Scattered throughout the documents are exercise blocks, with hidden
answers, and, in some cases, hints. The exercises are for
self-assessment of your understanding, but they are not mandatory.

Some of the exercises (labelled with the Linux penguin {{< fa brands
linux >}}) are related to the usage of the command line interfaces
(CLI), and how to obtain information about what a program does. This
is an essential skill when working in Linux/UNIX environments! These
exercises can be skipped if you are an experienced Linux/UNIX user.

An example exercise is provided here:

::: {.callout-exercise}

### Example exercise block

{{< fa brands linux >}} The `ls` command is used to list the contents
of a directory. What option provides a so-called long listing format?

::: {.callout-hint}

Type `ls --help` to show the options to `ls`.

:::

::: {.callout-answer}

The `-l` option uses the long listing format, i.e., the command to use
is `ls -l`.
