## Intended learning outcomes

### Course

- Present minimum toolkit of methods that should be known to anyone
  starting out in population genomics
- Sufficiently small for one-week workshop

### Lecture

- Present practical example of toolkit as applied in
  [@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020]
- Briefly discuss baseline model
  [@johri_RecommendationsImprovingStatistical_2022]

::: {.notes }

Aim of lecture is to:

- present a practical application of commonly used methods in
  population genomics
- link population genomics to population genetics
- discuss statistical inference and the need of a baseline model with
  which to compare observations and conclusions

#### What is population genomics?

Points from [@hahn_MolecularPopulationGenetics_2019, pp. 249-250]:

- whole-genome data instead of single loci - population genomics is
  population genetics for whole-genome sequences
  - if only this, not too exciting
- major promise: enables analyses not possible for single loci or that
  require genomic context
- addresses interactions between different forces, notably selection
  and demographic history

#### Some applications

- genome-wide scans for selection
  - selection vs demography (p. 251)
- methods for genome-wide scans (p. 258)

#### Caveats

- non-independence (p. 267)
  - different statistics rely on similar input
  - overlapping peaks from different statistics *not* independent

#### General points

[@hartl1997principles p. 469-470]:

- more emphasis on differences within populations
- goal: understand differences among genomes -> requires complete
  sequence data from multiple individuals

[@li_InferenceHumanPopulation_2011, supplementary notes, p. 6] on the
use of PSMC on autosomes:

"...highly consistent except for the very recent history,
demonstrating the power of using whole-genome data."

[@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020] is an example of a population
genomics study that applies methods that could be seen as a basic
foundation of population genomics. We believe these present a minimum
toolkit of methods that should be known to anyone starting out in
population genomics, and that is sufficiently small to be presented in
a one-week workshop. At the end of this lecture, we will discuss some
more advanced applications in population genomics.

**Genome assembly and sampling**

Why: most analyses require a *reference sequence* with which to
compare *resequenced samples*

Points to consider:

- choice of reference individual
- the number of populations
- the number of samples (more sites better than many samples per
     population)
- the geographical distribution of samples
- sequencing depth (low-coverage often sufficient)

#### Describe **genetic structure** and **demographic history**

Motivation:

- address basic question of why genetic structure looks the way it
  does
- demographic history may generate signals similar to selection

**Variation and demographic history**

Why: summarizing *diversity* provides (indirect) information on
population size and more, as does the *linkage structure*. Estimate
*demographic history* since fluctuating population size may produce
signals similar to those of selection

- LD decay: important for imputation (e.g.,
  stephens_AccountingDecayLinkage_2005) and setting window size for
  genome scans, where a common rule of thumb is to set the size larger
  than the genome background: this ensures windows are, in some sense,
  independent
- The extent of LD and its decay with genetic distance are useful
  parameters for determining the number of markers needed to
  successfully map a QTL, and the resolution with which the trait can
  be successfully mapped otyama_EvaluationLinkageDisequilibrium_2019
- 0.363% average pi, but large variation.
- many psmc plots show decline in population size, which could be an
  effect of bottleneck during pleistocene. Also population divergence
  (ghost ancestral populations, splits, extinction) can affect
  population size
- in aDNA studies missingness is common (i.e., heterozygotes are
  underestimated) and has to be accounted for since coalescence times
  are affected and may influence estimate of population size

#### Characterize **population structure**

Motivation:

1. identify populations for contrasts in e.g. selection scans
2. identify admixed individuals that should be removed from analyses
3. identify barriers to gene flow etc

**Population structure:**

Why: many reasons: 1) identifying populations for contrasts in e.g.
selection scans 2) identify admixed individuals that should be removed
from analyses 3) identify barriers to gene flow etc

- no discernible relationship between geographic distance and genetic
  differentiation -> gene flow
  - for this reason, Fst between populations is low
- EEMS (Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces) models relationship
  between genetics and geography

#### Genomic scans for **selection**

Motivation: identify loci associated with adaptation / selection

- little differentiation over reefs, however thermal regimes
- genomic scan for $\pi$ (diversity) outliers

**Selection scan**

Why: identify loci associated with adaptation / selection, which
provides potential mechanisms for adaptation, as well as information
that could be important for conservation strategies

Little differentiation across reefs -> little population structure
over hundreds of kilometers. However, there are environmental
differences (thermal regimes). Scan for pi outliers:

- points to *sacsin* gene
- h12 measures the frequency of the two most common haplotypes; red
  indicate 0.01% outlier genome-wide
- 4C: tree for central 1kb region in *sacsin* deeper than split from
  *A.digitifera* and *A.tenuis*
  - variation in *sacsin* has been maintained for long time
  - co-chaperone for heat-shock protein Hsp70

[@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020] paper has population genetics
in title -> population genetics is a key ingredient.

Population genetics focuses on the genetic basis of evolution. It is
mainly a theoretical subject, owing to the slow changes of genetic
variation. As such, it tries to explain the shape and structure of
genetic variation from theoretical predictions and models.

- note: studied loci have often not been randomly chosen, which is
  another argument for whole-genome studies
- enabler: sequencing technology

[@fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020] paper has population genetics
in title -> population genetics is a key ingredient.

Refer to Hahn's points about learning something about global patterns:

- selection acts locally, demography globally
- the structure of genetic variation and how it depends on
  - recombination landscapes and linked selection
  - demographic changes
  - identification of neutral loci

So, not simply about applying 10000 selection tests for multiple loci

All of the points above point to the importance of statistics which
implies mathematics / computational skills important

## Statistical inference in population genomics

The data deluge requires advanced statistical methods and models to do
inference. Today data production outpaces theoretical advances.
Therefore, take care not to attach too much faith to a test that
explains data well.

::: {.fragment}

A population genomics study should aim at generating a baseline model
that takes into account the processes that shape genetic variation
[@johri_RecommendationsImprovingStatistical_2022]:

1. mutation
2. recombination
3. gene conversion
4. purifying selection acting on functional regions and its effects on
   linked variants (background selection)
5. genetic drift with demographic history and geographic structure

:::

::: {.notes}

Caution against adaptationist storytelling; always compare to a
baseline model that takes potential confounding factors into account
