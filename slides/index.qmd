### A note on usage

Html slides have been authored using [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/)
and can be viewed directly in the browser. In some cases, there are
accompanying speaker notes that can be viewed by pressing `s`.
Whenever there is a [{{< fa rectangle-list >}}]({{< var recipes.base
>}}) symbol, it links to a recipe that is related to the figure or
content on the active slide.
