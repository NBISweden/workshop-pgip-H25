    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nRegardless of how a raw variant call set has been produced, the calls will be of varying quality for a number of reasons. For high-coverage sequencing, the two most common are incompleteness of the reference sequence and misalignments in repetitive regions (Li, 2014). Low-coverage sequencing comes with its own biases and issues, with the most important being the difficulty to accurately call genotypes (Maruki & Lynch, 2017).\nIn order to improve the accuracy of downstream inference, a number of analysis-dependent quality control filters should be applied to the raw variant call set (for a concise summary, see Lou et al. (2021)). In this exercise, we will begin by applying filters to the variant file containing variant sites only, followed by a more general approach based on depth filtering of a variant file consisting of all sites, variant as well as invariant.\nIt is worthwhile to spend time thinking about filtering. As we will see, there are numerous metrics to filter on, and different applications require different filters. This is not as straightforward as it first may seem, and even experts struggle to get filtering settings right.\nSome recommended data filters\nThere are many ways to filter data. Choosing the right set of filters is not easy, and choosing appropriate thresholds depends on application, among other things. Below we list some recommended data filters and thresholds that have general applicability and recently have been reviewed (Lou et al., 2021, Table 3); but see also (Hemstrom et al., 2024):\n\n\ndepth: Given the difficulty of accurately genotyping low-coverage sites, it is recommended to set a minimum read depth cutoff to remove false positive calls. It is also recommended to set a maximum depth cutoff as excessive coverage is often due to mappings to repetitive regions. The thresholds will depend on the depth profile over all sites, but is usually chosen as a range around the mean or median depth (e.g. lower threshold 0.8X mean, upper threshold median + 2 standard deviations).\n\nminimum number of individuals: To avoid sites with too much missing data across individuals, a common requirement is that a minimum number (fraction) of individuals, say 75%, have sequence coverage (depth-based filter) or genotype calls.\n\nquality (p-value): Most variant calling software provide a Phred-scaled probability score that a genotype is a true genotype. Quality values below 20 (i.e., 1%) should not be trusted, but could be set much higher (i.e., lower p-value) depending on application. Note that if a VCF file includes invariant sites, they have quality values set to 0, which renders quality based filtering inappropriate.\n\nMAF: Filter sites based on a minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold. The appropriate choice depends on application. For instance, for PCA or admixture analyses, low-frequency SNPs are uninformative, and a reasonably large cutoff (say, 0.05-0.10) could be set. If an analysis depends on invariant sites, this filter should not be applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFor applications where invariant sites should be included, such as genetic diversity calculations, neither quality nor MAF filtering should be applied.",

    "text": "Basic filtering of a VCF file1\n\nWe will begin by creating filters for a VCF file consisting of variant sites only for red and yellow ecotypes. Before we start, let’s review some statistics for the entire (unfiltered) call set:\n\nbcftools stats variantsites.vcf.gz | grep ^SN\n\nSN  0   number of samples:  10\nSN  0   number of records:  127663\nSN  0   number of no-ALTs:  0\nSN  0   number of SNPs: 104774\nSN  0   number of MNPs: 0\nSN  0   number of indels:   23067\nSN  0   number of others:   0\nSN  0   number of multiallelic sites:   10333\nSN  0   number of multiallelic SNP sites:   2066\n\n\nKeep track of these numbers as we will use them to evaluate the effects of filtering.\nWhen to remove complex variants?\nAs you can see, the raw variant data set contains indels as well as multiallelic SNPs. Often we are mainly concerned with SNPs, in particular bi-allelic SNPs, which begs the question: when should we remove indels and multiallelic sites; prior to or after quality filtering? This will depend on the research question, but a general recommendation is to filter on quality measures first, and then remove more complex variants. This is the approach we opt for here.\nGenerate random subset of variants\nDepending on the size of a study, both in terms of reference sequence and number of samples, the VCF output can become large; a VCF file may in fact contain millions of variants and be several hundred GB! We want to create filters by examining distributions of VCF quality metrics and setting reasonable cutoffs. In order to decrease run time, we will look at a random sample of sites. We use the vcflib program vcfrandomsample to randomly sample approximately 100,000 sites from our VCF file2:\n\n# Set parameter r = 100000 / total number of variants\nbcftools view variantsites.vcf.gz | vcfrandomsample -r 0.9 |\\\n    bgzip -c &gt; variantsites.subset.vcf.gz\nbcftools index variantsites.subset.vcf.gz\nbcftools stats variantsites.subset.vcf.gz |\\\n    grep \"number of records:\"\n\nSN  0   number of records:  114957\n\n\nThe -r parameter sets the rate of sampling which is why we get approximately 100,000 sites. You will need to adjust this parameter accordingly.\nWe will now use vcftools to compile statistics. By default, vcftools outputs results to files with a prefix out. in the current directory. You can read up on settings and options by consulting the man pages with man vcftools3. Therefore, we define a variable OUT where we will output our quality metrics, along with a variable referencing our variant subset:\n\nmkdir -p vcftools\nOUT=vcftools/variantsites.subset\nVCF=variantsites.subset.vcf.gz\n\nGenerate statistics for filters\nvcftools can compile many different kinds of statistics. Below we will focus on the ones relevant to our data filters. We will generate metrics and plot results as we go along, with the goal of generating a set of filtering thresholds to apply to the data.\nTotal depth per site\nTo get a general overview of depth of coverage, we first generate the average depth per sample4:\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --depth --out $OUT 2&gt;/dev/null\ncat ${OUT}.idepth\ncsvtk summary -t -f MEAN_DEPTH:mean ${OUT}.idepth\n\nINDV    N_SITES MEAN_DEPTH\nPUN-R-ELF   110937  8.87862\nPUN-R-JMC   111227  9.83666\nPUN-R-LH    111758  9.72573\nPUN-R-MT    111401  9.77112\nPUN-R-UCSD  111562  9.21385\nPUN-Y-BCRD  110026  10.302\nPUN-Y-INJ   109427  8.70856\nPUN-Y-LO    108345  8.3459\nPUN-Y-PCT   109868  9.51694\nPUN-Y-POTR  110144  8.87137\nMEAN_DEPTH:mean\n9.32\n\n\nThe average coverage over all samples is 9.3X. This actually is in the low range for a protocol based on explicitly calling genotypes. At 5X coverage, there may be a high probability that only one of the alleles has been sampled (Nielsen et al., 2011), whereby sequencing errors may be mistaken for true variation.\nThen we calculate depth per site to see if we can identify reasonable depth cutoffs:\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --site-depth --out $OUT 2&gt;/dev/null\nhead -n 3 ${OUT}.ldepth\n\nCHROM   POS SUM_DEPTH   SUMSQ_DEPTH\nLG4 2105    9   23\nLG4 2130    11  21\n\n\nSo, for each position, we have a value (column SUM_DEPTH) for the total depth across all samples.\nWe plot the distribution of total depths by counting how many times each depth is observed. This can be done with csvtk summary where we count positions and group (-g) by the SUM_DEPTH value:5\n\ncsvtk summary -t -g SUM_DEPTH -f POS:count -w 0 ${OUT}.ldepth |\\\n csvtk sort -t -k 1:n |\\\n csvtk plot line -t - -x SUM_DEPTH -y POS:count \\\n    --point-size 0.01 --xlab \"Depth of coverage (X)\" \\\n    --ylab \"Genome coverage (bp)\" \\\n    --width 9.0 --height 3.5 &gt; $OUT.ldepth.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of the total depth per site for all samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn csvtk as plotting software\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are of course perfectly welcome to use R or some other software to make these plots. We choose to generate the plots using csvtk to avoid too much context switching, and also because it emulates much of the functionality in R, albeit much less powerful when it comes to plotting.\n\n\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, most sites fall within a peak, but also that there are sites with very high coverage, up to ten times as high as the depth at the peak maximum. We calculate some range statistics to get an idea of the spread. The following csvtk command will calculate the minimum, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile, and maximum of the third column (SUM_DEPTH):\n\ncsvtk summary -t -f 3:min,3:q1,3:median,3:mean,3:q3,3:max,3:stdev vcftools/variantsites.subset.ldepth\n\nSUM_DEPTH:min   SUM_DEPTH:q1    SUM_DEPTH:median    SUM_DEPTH:mean  SUM_DEPTH:q3    SUM_DEPTH:max   SUM_DEPTH:stdev\n1.00    55.00   72.00   89.56   88.00   34131.00    251.20\n\n\nThe range from the first quartile (q1) to the third (q3) is 55-88, showing most sites have a depth between 50-100X. We redraw the plot to zoom in on the peak:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Zoomed in version of Figure 1 which was achieved by adding the options --x-min 0 --x-max 140 --y-max 2500 to the plotting call.\n\n\nWe could choose a filter based on the quantile statistics above, or by eye-balling the graph. In this example, we could have chosen the range 50-150X, which equates to 5-15X depth per sample; note that your values will probably be different.\nAs an aside, we mention that there is a command to directly get the per-site mean depth, --site-mean-depth:\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --site-mean-depth --out $OUT 2&gt;/dev/null\nhead -n 3 ${OUT}.ldepth.mean\n\nCHROM   POS MEAN_DEPTH  VAR_DEPTH\nLG4 2105    2.25    0.916667\nLG4 2130    1.57143 0.619048\n\n\nVariant quality distribution\nAnother quantity of interest is the variant quality. Recall, variant quality scores are Phred-scaled scores, meaning a value of 10 has a 10% chance of being wrong, 20 a 1% chance, and so on; you typically want to at least filter on 20 or even higher. We extract and plot the quality values below:\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --site-quality --out $OUT\n\n\n# To improve histogram, filter out extreme quality scores. You\n# may have to fiddle with the exact values\ncsvtk filter -t -f \"QUAL&gt;0\" -f \"QUAL&lt;1000\" ${OUT}.lqual  | \\\n csvtk summary -t -g QUAL -f POS:count -w 0 - |\\\n csvtk sort -t -k 1:n |\\\n csvtk plot hist -t --bins 100 - \\\n          --xlab \"Quality value\" \\\n    --ylab \"Count\" \\\n    --width 9.0 --height 3.5 &gt; $OUT.lqual.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of variant quality scores.\n\n\nClearly most quality scores are above 20-30. For many applications, we recommend setting 30 as the cutoff.\nMinor allele frequency distribution\nSince we are going to calculate nucleotide diversities, we will not filter on the minor allele frequency (MAF) here. Nevertheless, we generate the distribution and plot for discussion purposes. The --freq2 will output the frequencies only, adding the option --max-alleles 2 to focus only on bi-allelic sites:\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --freq2 --out $OUT --max-alleles 2 2&gt;/dev/null\nhead -n 3 ${OUT}.frq\n\nCHROM   POS N_ALLELES   N_CHR   {FREQ}\nLG4 2105    2   4   0   1\nLG4 2130    2   14  0.857143    0.142857\n\n\nThe last two columns are frequencies ordered according to the reference allele. Therefore, we need to pick the minimum value to get the MAF. We can use csvtk mutate to create a new column\n\ncsvtk fix -t ${OUT}.frq 2&gt;/dev/null |\\\n csvtk mutate2 -t -n maf -e '${5} &gt; ${6} ? \"${6}\" : \"${5}\" ' - |\\\n csvtk plot hist -t --bins 20 -f maf - \\\n       --xlab \"Minor allele frequency\" \\\n       --ylab \"Count\" \\\n       --width 9.0 --height 3.5 &gt; $OUT.frq.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of minor allele frequencies.\n\n\nSince our variant file consists of 10 individuals, that is, 20 chromosomes, there are only so many frequencies that we can observe, which is why the histogram looks a bit disconnected6. In fact, given 20 chromosomes, MAF=0.05 corresponds to one alternative allele among all individuals (singleton), MAF=0.1 to two, and so on. The maximum value is 0.5, which is to be expected, as it is a minor allele frequency. We note that there are more sites with a low minor allele frequency, which in practice means there are many singleton variants.\nThis is where filtering on MAF can get tricky. Singletons may correspond to sequencing error, but if too hard a filter is applied, the resulting site frequency spectrum (SFS) will be skewed. For statistics that are based on the SFS, this may lead biased estimates. Since we will be applying such a statistic, we do not filter on the MAF here. Note, however, that for other applications, such as population structure, it may be warranted to more stringently (say, MAF&gt;0.1) filter out low-frequency variants.\nMissing data for individuals and sites\nThe proportion missing data per individual can indicate whether the input DNA was of poor quality, and that the individual should be excluded from analysis. Note that in this case, missing data refers to a missing genotype call and not sequencing depth!\nWe can calculate the proportion of missing data\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --missing-indv --out $OUT 2&gt;/dev/null\nhead -n 3 ${OUT}.imiss\n\nINDV    N_DATA  N_GENOTYPES_FILTERED    N_MISS  F_MISS\nPUN-R-ELF   114957  0   16729   0.145524\nPUN-R-JMC   114957  0   14742   0.128239\n\n\nand look at the results, focusing on the F_MISS column (proportion missing sites):\n\ncsvtk plot hist -t --x-min 0 -f F_MISS ${OUT}.imiss &gt; ${OUT}.imiss.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Distribution of missingness per sample.\n\n\nHere, the proportion lies in the range 0.06-0.10 for all samples, which indicates good coverage of all samples and we refrain from taking any action.\nSimilarly, we can look at missingness per site. This is related to the filter based on minimum number of individuals suggested by Lou et al. (2021). We calculate\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --missing-site --out $OUT 2&gt;/dev/null\nhead -n 3 ${OUT}.lmiss\n\nCHR POS N_DATA  N_GENOTYPE_FILTERED N_MISS  F_MISS\nLG4 2105    20  0   16  0.8\nLG4 2130    20  0   6   0.3\n\n\nand plot to get an idea of if there are sites that lack data.\n\ncsvtk plot hist --bins 20 -t -f F_MISS ${OUT}.lmiss &gt; ${OUT}.lmiss.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of missingness among sites.\n\n\nAs Figure 6 shows, many sites have no or little missing data, but given the low coverage, there is a non-negligible number of sites with higher missingness. We calculate range statistics to get a feeling for a good cutoff:\n\ncsvtk summary -t -f 6:min,6:q1,6:median,6:mean,6:q3,6:max vcftools/variantsites.subset.lmiss\n\nF_MISS:min  F_MISS:q1   F_MISS:median   F_MISS:mean F_MISS:q3   F_MISS:max\n0.00    0.00    0.10    0.14    0.20    0.90\n\n\nThe mean missingness is 8%, so we can safely use 25% missingness as threshold. Typical values of tolerated missingness lie in the range 5-25%. Note that vcftools interprets this value as 1 - missingness, so it has to be inverted to 75% when filtering!\nHeterozygosity\nvcftools can calculate the heterozygosity per individual. More specifically, it estimates the inbreeding coefficient F for each individual.\n\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --het --out $OUT 2&gt;/dev/null\ncat ${OUT}.het\n\nINDV    O(HOM)  E(HOM)  N_SITES F\nPUN-R-ELF   72485   65901.2 89065   0.28423\nPUN-R-JMC   68990   67087.4 90716   0.08052\nPUN-R-LH    71213   66575.5 89929   0.19858\nPUN-R-MT    70401   66522.3 89902   0.16590\nPUN-R-UCSD  75240   66221.5 89678   0.38448\nPUN-Y-BCRD  71239   66729.7 90163   0.19243\nPUN-Y-INJ   72368   65064.2 87675   0.32302\nPUN-Y-LO    74464   64524.6 87454   0.43348\nPUN-Y-PCT   76192   65692.9 89040   0.44970\nPUN-Y-POTR  72009   64917.9 87768   0.31033\n\n\nHere, F is a measure of how much the observed homozygotes O(HOM) differ from the expected (E(HOM); expected by chance under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and may be negative. vcftools calculates F from the expression \\(F=(O-E)/(N-E)\\)7, which you can verify by substituting the variables in the output.\nIf F is positive (\\(O(HOM) &gt; E(HOM)\\)), i.e., there are more observed homozygotes than expected, then there is a deficit of heterozygotes, which could be a sign of inbreeding or signs of allelic dropout in case of low sequencing coverage.\nIf F is negative, there are fewer observed homozygotes than expected, or conversely, an excess of heterozygotes. This could be indicative of poor sequence quality (bad mappings) or contamination (Purcell et al., 2007).\nThe underlying assumption is HWE, which holds for F=0.\nIn this case, we know that the samples are from two different populations, red and yellow. In such cases, we actually expect a deficit of heterozygotes (and consequently, positive F) simply due to something called the Wahlund effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient is a population-level statistic and is not reliable for small sample sizes (\\(n&lt;10\\), say). Therefore, our sample size is in the lower range and the results should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse bcftools view -s SAMPLENAMES | vcftools --vcf - --het --stdout to calculate the heterozygosity for red and yellow samples. Substitute SAMPLENAMES for a comma-separated list of samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbcftools view -s PUN-R-ELF,PUN-R-JMC,PUN-R-LH,PUN-R-MT,PUN-R-UCSD $VCF |\\\n vcftools --vcf - --het --stdout 2&gt;/dev/null\n\nINDV    O(HOM)  E(HOM)  N_SITES F\nPUN-R-ELF   41544   37855.6 58124   0.18198\nPUN-R-JMC   37612   38594.6 59338   -0.04737\nPUN-R-LH    39682   38057.9 58398   0.07985\nPUN-R-MT    38895   38056.4 58396   0.04123\nPUN-R-UCSD  43385   37656.1 57823   0.28408\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering the VCF\nNow that we have decided on filters we can apply them to the VCF. We first set the filters as variables:\n\nMISS=0.75\nQUAL=30\nMIN_DEPTH=5\nMAX_DEPTH=15\n\nand run vcftools as follows:\n\nOUTVCF=${VCF%.subset.vcf.gz}.filtered.vcf.gz\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF \\\n   --remove-indels --max-missing $MISS \\\n   --min-meanDP $MIN_DEPTH --max-meanDP $MAX_DEPTH \\\n   --minDP $MIN_DEPTH --maxDP $MAX_DEPTH --recode \\\n   --stdout 2&gt;/dev/null |\n gzip -c &gt; $OUTVCF\n\nCompare the results with the original input:\n\nbcftools stats $OUTVCF | grep \"^SN\"\n\nSN  0   number of samples:  10\nSN  0   number of records:  31784\nSN  0   number of no-ALTs:  0\nSN  0   number of SNPs: 31665\nSN  0   number of MNPs: 0\nSN  0   number of indels:   0\nSN  0   number of others:   0\nSN  0   number of multiallelic sites:   1350\nSN  0   number of multiallelic SNP sites:   582\n\n\nQuite a substantial portion variants have in fact been removed, which here can most likely be attributed to the low average sequencing coverage.",

    "section": "Workflow managers",
    "text": "Workflow managers\nThe advent of next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have contributed to increasing data complexity and data volumes, leading to scalability and reproducibility issues (Wratten et al., 2021). A number of workflow managers have beed developed to meet these needs, including Snakemake (Mölder et al., 2021) and Nextflow (Di Tommaso et al., 2017).\nIn this exercise, we will use Snakemake to run a variant calling workflow from start to end. We urge the reader to briefly skim the Snakefile1, the Snakemake command file. We will briefly describe how Snakemake works in the next section, but going into any details is out of the scope of this exercise. See the Snakemake documentation for more information, and if you want to learn more, there are NBIS courses on reproducible research and Snakemake.\nA very brief overview of a Snakefile\nA Snakemake workflow consists of rules that determine how inputs are connected to outputs. Rules are defined in a so-called Snakefile. Below is an example of a bare minimum rule:\nrule samtools_index:\n    output:\n        \"ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta.fai\"\n    input:\n        \"ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\"\n    shell:\n        \"samtools faidx {input} -o {output}\"\nThe rule consists of a name (samtools_faidx) and keywords (output, input, shell). The shell keyword defines a shell command to be run (samtools faidx), which will take the input (ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta) and produce an output (ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta.fai). Note here the curly brackets; these are Snakemake wildcards which makes it possible to generalize rules to match file name patterns.\nProvided the input file exists, running snakemake would produce the output, unless the output already exists. This is one neat feature of workflow managers - they are designed to detect whether input files are newer than output files, and only then will they forcefully regenerate the output2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the samtools_index rule to a file called Snakefile and run snakemake --dry-run --printshellcmds --force (alternatively snakemake -n -p). What happens?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnakemake will output what jobs it will run, the reason, and which shell command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA workflow is built by connecting outputs from one rule to inputs of another. A rule can depend on multiple inputs, as well as produce multiple outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above Snakefile, add a rule count_lines that uses the input ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta.fai to generate the output file wc.txt, and where the shell command is uses wc -l to count lines in the input and redirect (&gt;) to output. Then run the command snakemake wc.txt and look at the contents of the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrule samtools_index:\n    output:\n        \"ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta.fai\"\n    input:\n        \"ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\"\n    shell:\n        \"samtools faidx {input} -o {output}\"\n\nrule count_lines:\n    output: \"wc.txt\"\n    input: \"ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta.fai\"\n    shell: \"wc -l {input} &gt; {output}\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure to remove the Snakefile before proceeding as it otherwise will take precedence over the workflow/Snakefile.\n\n\nA look into the variant calling Snakefile\nOpen workflow/Snakefile and look briefly at the contents. The top portion contains code to read the sampleinfo file and defines a variable REFERENCE that can be used throughout3:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read sampleinfo and subset to\nsampleinfo = pd.read_csv(\"sampleinfo.csv\")\nsampleinfo = sampleinfo.loc[sampleinfo.SampleAlias.str.startswith(\"PUN\")]\\\n                       .set_index(\"SampleAlias\")\nsamples = sampleinfo.index.values\n\nREFERENCE = \"ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\"\n\nBy default, Snakemake runs the argument if no filename is provided when running. By convention, the first rule is called all:\n\nrule all:\n    input: \"multiqc_report.html\",\n\nThis is a so-called pseudo-rule which are used to list the final desired output file. The workflow will figure out how to generate necessary inputs.\nThe remainder of the file contain the “regular” rule definitions. They have been kept as simple as possible, but you will notice that we have made use of some additional code constructs not mentioned above. Skim the file, and look at the multiqc rule at the bottom. Notice how it is used to “collect” necessary inputs which all have to be generated before the report is written.\nIt can be difficult to get an overview of the workflow by simply looking at the Snakefile. Therefore, we end by showing a rulegraph of the workflow, which shows how rules are connected:\n\nsnakemake --rulegraph | dot -Tpng | display\n\n\n\nsnakemake_dag\n\n\n0\n\nall\n1\n\nmultiqc\n1-&gt;0\n\n\n2\n\nfastqc\n2-&gt;1\n\n\n3\n\nbcftools_stats\n3-&gt;1\n\n\n4\n\ngatk_genotype_gvcfs\n4-&gt;3\n\n\n5\n\ngatk_combine_gvcfs\n5-&gt;4\n\n\n6\n\ngatk_haplotypecaller_bqsr\n6-&gt;5\n\n\n7\n\ngatk_apply_bqsr\n7-&gt;6\n\n\n8\n\npicard_mark_duplicates\n8-&gt;1\n\n\n8-&gt;7\n\n\n11\n\ngatk_base_recalibrator\n8-&gt;11\n\n\n12\n\ngatk_haplotypecaller_raw\n8-&gt;12\n\n\n9\n\nbwa_mem\n9-&gt;8\n\n\n15\n\nqualimap_bamqc\n9-&gt;15\n\n\n10\n\nbwa_index\n10-&gt;9\n\n\n11-&gt;7\n\n\n12-&gt;11\n\n\n13\n\npicard_create_sequence_dictionary\n13-&gt;4\n\n\n13-&gt;6\n\n\n13-&gt;12\n\n\n14\n\nsamtools_faidx\n14-&gt;4\n\n\n14-&gt;6\n\n\n14-&gt;12\n\n\n15-&gt;1\n\n:::\nRunning the workflow\nNow we turn to actually running the workflow.

    "text": "Dardel @ PDC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisite: SUPR account\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to run the exercises on the Dardel HPC you need an account. Follow the instructions at the precourse page.\n\n\n\nWe will primarily be using KTH’s high-performance computing (HPC) center Dardel to run exercises. Course material will be hosted in a dedicated course project directory /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/pgip_2025.\nWorking directory setup\nWe recommend you setup a working directory based on your username in /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/pgip_2025/users in which to run your exercises:\nmkdir -p /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/pgip_2025/users/YOURUSERNAME\ncd /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/pgip_2025/users/YOURUSERNAME\npixi environments and pgip CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\n\nThis feature is experimental and may not work as intended.\n\n\nIn order to improve reproducibility and facilitate package setup, we have grouped exercise tools in pixi virtual environments1 Exercise environments are named e-EXERCISE-NAME and can be activated with a custom command line (CLI) tool called pgip. To activate the CLI, do the following steps:\nsource /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/pgip_2025/init.sh\npgip_activate\nNow you should have access to pgip, which among other things lets you setup exercise data and launch notebooks. In addition, there are two commands pgip_elist and pgip_shell. pgip_elist lists available environments and pgip_shell ENVIRONMENT_NAME starts a shell with the environment activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun pgip_activate before pgip_shell\n\n\n\nIt is important that you run pgip_activate first as exiting would terminate your session. Exiting from the shell will pop you back to the activated default environment.\n\n\nThinLinc\nKTH provides a remote desktop program called ThinLinc which lets you connect to a remote server and access programs via a virtual desktop. To use, you first need to download the ThinLinc client (tlclient). To connect, launch tlclient and authenticate with either Kerberos or SSH. See the PDC documentation for more documentation.\nLaunching graphical applications\nThe is a launcher located in the menu bar that should let you start graphical applications. If that doesn’t work, you can always\nInteractive jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease do not book more than 10 cores\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have priviliged access to a limited number of nodes. Please do not book more than 10 cores or else your fellow students will experience long waiting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to login to a compute node before running any compute-intensive commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll computations should be run on a compute node. You can request an interactive session with the salloc command. For example, to request an eight hour job on 10 cores, run\nsalloc -A naiss2025-22-825 -n 10 \\\n   --time 08:00:00 \\\n   --reservation=&lt;name of reservation&gt; \\\n   --no-shell\nwhere &lt;name of reservation&gt; needs to be replaced by the node reservations, which will typically be unique for every day.\nThe --no-shell option will immediately exit the allocated node but keep the Slurm job active. Make a note of the allocated node ID and use ssh to access it.\nssh node_id\nAccessing notebooks on compute nodes\nSee ThinLinc for a potentially easier way to access compute nodes and resources.\nNotebooks are run in browser sessions, but if run on compute nodes they are not directly accessible from the client. The trick is to set up double port forwarding, in which a port is forwarded from the compute node to the login node and on to your client. If you use the pgip CLI to launch a notebook, it will look as follows:\npgip notebook jupyter --port 9999\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:notebook\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:Running jupyter lab  --no-browser --port=9999\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:Jupyter lab running at http://localhost:9999\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:To stop Jupyter Notebook, press Ctrl+C\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:For port forwarding to login node, on login node run:\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:ssh -L 9999:localhost:9999 nid002581 -N -f\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:For port forwarding to client localhost, on client run:\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:ssh -L 9999:localhost:9999 dardel.pdc.kth.se -N -f\nINFO:pgip_cli.commands.notebook:\nDo you want to continue? [Y/n]:\nHere, NODEID is the compute node id. To enable port forwarding, you need to run the to ssh -L ... commands, and voilà, you should be able to access the notebook at localhost:9999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe port id must be unique and in the recommended range 1024-49151\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorials\nPDC hosts tutorials and user guides at https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc. In particular, https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/basics/quickstart has information on how to connect to and work on Dardel.",

(2012)\n\n\n\nAfter allozyme era, the study of genetic diversity was largely neglected due to lack of genome-wide data, but with advent of population genomics becoming a hot topic again.\n\nEllegren & Galtier (2016)\n\n\n\n\nLewontin’s paradox: genetic diversity range smaller than variation among species in population size\n\n\n\nRiddle: why is genetic diversity range so narrow? Possibly there are lower and upper limits.\nLower limit: censoring effect, i.e., when diversity passes a lower limit, population is driven to extinction due to inability to adapt\nUpper limit: functional/structural constraints, e.g., impaired chromosome pairing or reproductive incompatibilities\nLinked selection, that is, variation-reducing selection. Larger populations have higher influx of new mutations, so if more draft, higher reduction in diversity. Would require strong frequent levels of selection; little support for this in literature.\nPurifying selection. Nearly neutral model could explain narrow range.\n(Ellegren & Galtier, 2016) Upper limit could in part be explained by linked selection (Corbett-Detig et al., 2015)",

It ranges between 0 and 1 and has the interpretation 0: no differentiation, 1: complete fixation of alternate alleles in subpopulations\n\nExample: site 3 has F_{\\mathrm{ST}}=1 as it is fixed in black, not present in blue\n\n\nThere are many ways to express and calculate F_{\\mathrm{ST}}.

(a) Comparison of two methods for computing π (or dXY) in the face of missing data. These methods follow the first expression of Equation 1 but differ in how they calculate the numerator and denominator. In Case 1, all missing data is assumed to be present but invariant. This results in a deflated estimate of π. In Case 2, missing data are simply omitted from the calculation, both in terms of the number of sites (the final denominator) and the component denominators for each site (the n choose two terms). This results in an unbiased estimate of π. (b) The adjusted π method (Case 2) as implemented for VCFs in pixy. The example VCF (input) contains the same four haplotypes as (a). Invariant sites are represented as sites with no ALT allele, and greyed-out sites are those that failed to pass a genotype filter requiring a minimum number of reads covering the genotype (Depth ≥ 10 in this case)",

The reason is GWAS/QTL requires a phenotype whereas genome scans are data-driven.\nCaption (fig 1):\n\nFig. 1 (a) Effects of genetic hitch-hiking along a recombining chromosome. Hori- zontal lines depict a population sample of homologous chromosomes, and filled symbols depict neutral mutations. In this example an advantageous mutation (open symbol) arises and is rapidly driven to fixation by positive selection. Although the mutation is recombined against new genetic backgrounds during the course of the selective sweep, a sizable fraction of the ancestral haplotype (shown in red) also becomes fixed. Consequently, neutral variants that were initially linked to the advantageous mutation undergo a dramatic increase in frequency as a result of hitchhiking. (b) In this example, locus 3 has been rendered monomorphic by a selective sweep. Sampled gene copies (denoted by tips of the gene tree) share a very recent common ancestor, and π = 0 (where π = nucleotide diversity; Nei & Li 1979). comparison, unlinked, neutrally evolving regions of the genome (loci 1, 2, and 4) are characterized by deeper genealogies, and higher levels of nucleotide diversity (π = 0.019–0.020). Note that the gene trees depict the true genealogies of the samples, not the genealogies inferred from observed variation.",

For instance, Talla et al. (2019) include GATK tri-allelic sites due to different bi-allelic pairs segregating in different subpopulations (e.g. A/G in pop 1, A/T in pop 2)\nVerbose explanations of filters\nSource: (Lou et al., 2021)\n\nBase quality scores are factored into the calculation of genotype likelihoods, so if they accurately reflect the probability of sequencing error, bases with low scores also carry useful information. However, base quality scores are sometimes miscalibrated, so noise may be reduced if bases with scores below a threshold (e.g., 20) are either trimmed off prior to analysis or ignored. Alternatively, all base quality scores can be recalibrated based on estimated error profiles in the data (see Section 3.1).\nMapping quality is not considered in genotype likelihood estimation in currently available tools, so it is often advisable to remove low-­confidence and/or nonuniquely mapped reads prior to analysis (e.g., reads with mapping quality &lt;20). Filtering out reads that do not map in proper pairs should also further increase confidence in reads being mapped to the correct location, but could cause biases in regions with structural variation.\nTo avoid sites with low or confounding data support in downstream analysis, minimum depth and/or minimum number of individual filters can be used to exclude sites with much reduced sequencing coverage compared to the rest of the genome (e.g., regions with low unique mapping rates, such as repetitive sequences). Appropriate thresholds will vary between data sets, but could, for example, exclude sites with read data for &lt;50% of individuals (globally or within each population), or with &lt;0.8× average depth across individuals (after filtering on mapping quality)\nMaximum depth filters are used to exclude sites with exceptionally high coverage (e.g., regions that are susceptible to dubious mapping, such as copy number variants). Common maximum depth thresholds could be one or two standard deviations above the median genome-­wide depth.\nPCR and optical duplicates can give inflated impressions of how many unique molecules have been sequenced, which—­particularly in the presence of preferential amplification of one allele—­ could bias genotype likelihood estimation. We therefore recommend removing duplicate reads prior to any analysis.\nReads mapped across indels are frequently misaligned, especially if the ends of reads span an indel. To avoid false SNP calls, we recommend either using dedicated tools to realign reads covering indels, using a haplotype-­based variant caller (e.g., freebayes or gatk) to estimate genotype likelihoods, or excluding bases flanking indels.\nIf the DNA insert in a library fragment is shorter than the combined length of paired reads, there will be a section of overlap between the forward and reverse reads. While some variant callers (e.g., gatk) account for the pseudoreplication in overlapping ends of read pairs, the current implementation of angsd treats each end of a read pair as independent (this may change in a future release (T. Korneliussen, personal communication)). When treated as independent, read support for overlapping sections will be “double counted,” which may bias genotype likelihoods. A conservative approach is to soft-­clip one of the overlapping read ends.\nThe significance threshold (often in the form of maximum p-­value) can be adjusted to fine-­tune the sensitivity of polymorphism detection, with lower p-­values leading to fewer, but higher confidence, SNP calls. A commonly used cut-­off is 10 −6.\nMost software programs for downstream analyses assume that all SNPs are biallelic, so SNPs with more than two alleles can be filtered out in the SNP identification step to avoid violation of such assumptions.\nFor many types of analysis, such as PCA, admixture analysis, detection of FST outliers and estimation of LD, low-­frequency SNPs are uninformative and can even bias results (e.g. Linck & Battey, 2019; Roesti et al., 2012). For those types of analysis, imposing a minimum MAF filter of 1%–­10% can substantially speed up computation time. Appropriate thresholds depend on coverage, sample size (how many copies does an MAF threshold correspond to) and the type of downstream analysis.\nFor comparison of parameter estimates for multiple populations, it is important to ensure that data are obtained for a shared set of sites and that SNP polarization (which allele we track the frequency of) is consistent. For programs such as angsd where population-­specific estimates are obtained by analysing the data from each population separately, a good strategy is to first conduct a global SNP calling with all samples and then restrict population-­specific analysis to those SNPs with consistent major and minor allele designations (-­doMajorMinor 3 in angsd) no MAF or SNP p-­value filter (because that would incorrectly generate “missing data” if a site is fixed in a particular population).",

Then there are three possible genotypes (states) aa, aA, and AA. Let n=0,1,2 be an integer corresponding to each genotype (i.e., it counts the number of A alleles).\nAssume individual mates with itself at random(!) starting in either of the three states.

We look at a single hermaphroditic individual that mates with itself at random. For each generation, given a genotype distribution, we calculate the outcome for the next generation. For instance, starting out in state 0 (only aa genotypes, hence only a alleles), we can only produce new aa genotypes and will therefore never leave state 0. The same holds for state 2. These states are absorbing states.\nStarting from state 1 (aA) we can get aa genotype with 25% probability, since the probability of picking one a is 50%, and we perform two draws. Similarly, we get AA with 25% probability, leaving 50% to aA.\nIn the next generation, the aA genotype frequency is 0.5, to be split in fractions 0.25, 0.5, 0.25 as before, and so on.\nTo study the system we therefore need to enumerate the probabilistic outcomes from each state (aa -&gt; 1, 0, 0, aA -&gt; 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, AA &lt;- 0, 0, 1). To get the state in next generation, we multiply the current distribution with these outcomes. The next slide gives Kimura’s example for the case where we have N=10 chromosomes.",

There are two allelic types. The x axis corresponds to the proportion of populations in a given state (e.g., the y value for x=3/10 corresponds to the proportion of populations with 3 alleles of one type and 7 of the other). At t=0 all populations are in state 5/10.\nKimura’s plot is very instructive and students are encouraged to test the recipe code, increasing the number of states incrementally. For large enough N, the histograms can be approximated by continuous distributions. This observation led Kimura (even though diffusion equations were originally introduced to genetics by Fisher in 1922) to apply diffusion theory to obtain probability densities of allele frequencies, leading in turn to compact expressions of fixation probabilities, expected ages of alleles, and more. A treatment of diffusion theory is outside the scope of this course; the interested reader can consult e.g., (Ewens, 2004).\nThe Buri experiment is an empirical demonstration of Kimura’s plot.\nOn the sampling model, (Charlesworth & Charlesworth, 2010, p. 231) says:\n\nIt is, however, impossible to write down a simple algebraic expression for P, even without selection and mutation. [The equation] is useful for obtaining numerical results for relatively small populations, but becomes computationally demanding when N becomes very large.",

The black-footed ferret population has declined dramatically through the twentieth century due to destruction of their habitat and sylvatic plague. In 1979, when the last known black-footed ferret died in captivity, they were thought to be extinct. In 1981, a very small wild population was rediscovered (40 individuals), but in 1985 this population suffered a number of disease outbreaks. At that point of the 18 remaining wild individuals were brought into captivity, 7 of which reproduced. Thanks to intense captive breeding efforts and conservation work, a wild population of over 300 individuals has been established since. However, because all of these individuals are descended from those 7 individuals who survived the bottleneck, diversity levels remain low. Wisely et al. measured heterozygosity at a number of microsatellites in individuals from museum collections, showing the sharp drop in diversity as population sizes crashed (see Figure 4.5).\n\nSegue: population size important; however, census population size is not always the measure we want when relating to genetic diversity",

    "text": "The neutral theory of evolution\n\n\nMutation drift balance, together with the observation during 50’s-60’s that polymorphism was more common than expected, is the foundation of the neutral theory of evolution (Kimura, 1983): allele frequencies may change and fix due to chance alone and not selection; most mutations behave as if they are neutral.\n\nNearly neutral theory (Ohta, 1973) was later developed to explain failure to predict scaling of polymorphism with population size: most mutations are not neutral but slightly deleterious and purged from population by natural selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Heterozygosity H=\\frac{\\theta}{1 + \\theta} predicted by the neutral theory. Shaded region shows typical heterozygosities in animals (y-axis). The observed N_e\\mu range is higher than predicted from plot. From Hurst (2009), Fig 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated to rate of substitution and molecular evolution is the work of Kimura that lead to the development of the neutral theory.\nMotivation: if polymorphic sites deleterious, should not expect much polymorphism.\nLow levels of polymorphism expected assuming little balancing selection (Hurst, 2009, p. 87); however electrophoretic studies showed polymorphism common. Would lead to detrimental load (Kimura & Ohta, 1971) -&gt; therefore majority of polymorphism must evolve neutrally (dynamics). Also: rate of evolution (on protein level) too high (Haldane’s dilemma)\nOn the shaded region: the observed range of N_e\\mu is larger than that which is predicted by the plot, and since \\mu is constrained within a couple of orders of magnitude, N_e must vary more than predicted by the (strictly) neutral theory.\nConversely: given a constrained \\mu, we observe a range of N_e\\mu that predicts a heterozygosity range H, which is much larger than that which we observe. In other words, the heterozygosity range is much lower than predicted by the neutral, given the observed N_e\\mu range, so some other process must reduce variation somehow.\nThe general idea of nearly neutral theory is that most mutations are slightly deleterious and therefore purged by natural selection, thereby reducing observed variation. The efficacy of purging depends in turn on the effective population size, such that species with small N_e will have a harder time getting rid of potentially damaging variants.",

At the end of this lecture, we will discuss some more advanced applications in population genomics.\nFigure caption:\n\nGenome assembly and sample collection for A. millepora. (A) A de novo assembly for the A. millepora genome was constructed by using a hybrid sequencing approach. The alignment of reads generated from two pools of aposymbiotic larvae was used to filter out symbiont contigs (fig. S3). Assembled coral contigs were aligned to previously published linkage maps (19, 80) to create a chromosome-scale assembly. (B) A total of 253 individuals were collected from across 12 reefs on the GBR in 2017. The size of the circles represents the number of individuals collected at each site, and the circles are colored according to the bleaching severity at each reef. The maximum degree heating weeks (DHW) is shown across the region from which samples were collected (and across the GBR in the inset). The spatial layer of DHW represents interpolated maximum values from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch (CRW) v3.1 satellite product at a resolution of 5 km. Each reef label is colored arbitrarily but consistent with labels presented in other figures.

(B) Nucleotide diversity was measured by the average pairwise differences per base pair (p) (86) for SNPs in 1-kb windows, using intergenic regions genome-wide. (C) Effective population sizes (Ne) inferred from 44 sequenced A. millepora genomes by using PSMC (35), assuming a mutation rate m of 4 × 10−9 per base pair per generation (20, 34). Although an error in the estimate of m will lead to a rescaling of both axes, it will not affect the qualitative conclusion of a decline in Ne toward the present. The x axis is scaled in terms of generations. This approach provides very little information about the recent past (here, less than ~104 generations).\n\nVariation and demographic history\nWhy: summarizing diversity provides (indirect) information on population size and more, as does the linkage structure. Estimate demographic history since fluctuating population size may produce signals similar to those of selection\n\nLD decay: important for imputation (e.g., stephens_AccountingDecayLinkage_2005) and setting window size for genome scans, where a common rule of thumb is to set the size larger than the genome background: this ensures windows are, in some sense, independent\n“The extent of LD and its decay with genetic distance are useful parameters for determining the number of markers needed to successfully map a QTL, and the resolution with which the trait can be successfully mapped” [otyama_EvaluationLinkageDisequilibrium_2019]\n0.363% average pi, but large variation.\nmany psmc plots show decline in population size, which could be an effect of bottleneck during pleistocene. Also population divergence (ghost ancestral populations, splits, extinction) can affect population size\nin aDNA studies missingness is common (i.e., heterozygotes are underestimated) and has to be accounted for since coalescence times are affected and may influence estimate of population size",

However, much of population genetic theory was developed before the nature of heredity (DNA) was known. In these early days, an allele would refer to variant forms of a gene, observed as differences in phenotypes. Genes, or loci, would be denoted using alphabetic characters, such as A, and allelic types could be referenced with indices, e.g., A_1, A_2, ..., A_n.\nTo simplify calculations, we often look at one locus and we assume two alleles, whereby we skip the indices and denote the allelic pairs A and a (although note that notations differs from author to author; for instance Gillespie (2004) uses A_1, A_2 for bi-allelic loci). For two-locus systems we simply denote the second allele with B, b, and so on.\nThe example shows a hypothetical locus having two alleles A and a that have phenotypes red and white flower color, and where heterozygotes are colored pink. The Punnett square shows how gamete combinations form genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.",

If allele frequencies are known, we can constrain the frequencies; for example, if A is known to be low (\\sim1%) AA genotype is very unlikely. Otherwise, could set all equal (flat prior).\n\n\n\ncf https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890511\nR. Li et al. (2009), Table 1, shows a nice numerical example of one way of setting priors. The authors assume a specific allele, G, in the reference sequence:\n–G–\nThey start by calculating the frequency of haploid genotypes. They first determine p_G by assuming a heterozygous SNP rate f=0.001, which means 1 in a 1000 sites has G/G genotype mutated to G/X, where X is one of {A,C,T}. They assume a transition to transversion (ts/tv) ratio of 4, meaning X=A four times as often as C or T (there is an error in the text where C is taken to be the transition; the numbers in the table are correct however). This gives the following haploid genotype frequencies:\n\\begin{align}\np_G & = 1-f = 0.999 \\\\\np_A & = 4f/6 = 6.67\\times10^{-4} \\\\\np_C & = f/6 = 1.67\\times10^{-4}\\\\\np_T & = f/6 =1.67\\times10^{-4}\n\\end{align}\nTo get the diploid genotypes, we simply multiply the corresponding entries, e.g., p_{AC} = p_Ap_C. For homozygote ALT, we need to account for the homozygous SNP rate r = 0.0005, where G/G mutates to X/X, for X one of {A,C,T}:\n\\begin{align}\np_{AA} & = p_Ap_A + 4r/6 = 3.33\\times10^{-4} \\\\\np_{AC} & = p_Ap_C = 1.11\\times10^{-7}\\\\\np_{AT} & = p_Ap_T = 1.11\\times10^{-7}\\\\\np_{CC} & = p_Cp_C + r/6 = 8.34\\times10^{-5} \\\\\np_{CG} & = p_Cp_G = 1.67\\times10^{-4}\\\\\np_{CT} & = p_Cp_T = 2.78\\times10^{-8}\\\\\np_{GG} & = 1 - f - r = 0.9985 \\\\\np_{GT} & = p_Gp_T = 1.67\\times10^{-4}\\\\\np_{TT} & = p_Tp_T + r = 8.34\\times10^{-5}\\\\\n\\end{align}",

    "text": "The monkeyflower genomic landscape\nRecently, Stankowski et al. (2019) used the monkeyflower system to investigate what forces affect the genomic landscape. Burri (2017) has suggested that background selection (BGS) is one of the main causes for correlations between genomic landscapes, and that one way to study this phenomenon is to look at closely related taxa. This is one of the objectives of the Stankowski et al. (2019) paper.\nThey performed whole-genome resequencing of 37 individuals from 7 subspecies and 2 ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus and its sister taxon M. clevelandii (Figure 1), all sampled in California (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Evolutionary relationships across the radiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sampling locations\n\n\nGenomewide statistics, such as diversity (\\(\\pi\\)), divergence (\\(d_{XY}\\)) and differentiation \\(F_{ST}\\), were calculated within and between taxa to generate genomic diversity landscapes. The landscapes were highly similar across taxa, and local variation in genomic features, such as gene density and recombination rate, was predictive of variation in landscape patterns. These features suggest the influence of selection, in particular BGS.\nAlthough many characteristics were predicted by a model where BGS is one of the main causes, there were deviations. Therefore, the authors performed simulations in SLiM (Haller & Messer, 2019) with alternative models to see whether other factors could explain the observed patterns.\nIn all, six scenarios were studied:\n\nneutral evolution\nBGS (non-neutral mutations are deleterious)\nBateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (BDMI); after split, a fraction variants deleterious in one population, neutral in other\npositive selection\nBGS and positive selection\nlocal adaptation; as 4 but also after split some variants are beneficial in one population, neutral in other\n\nFigure 3 shows typical results of the simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Genomic landscapes simulated under different divergence histories.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the authors found that although BGS plays a role, it does not sufficiently explain all observations, and that other aspects of natural selection (such as rapid adaptation) are responsible for the similarities between genomic landscapes.\nA locus that previously had been associated with differentiation of red and yellow ecotypes was investigated in more detail. The locus is located on linkage group 4 (LG4), and we will be using both a 3Mbp region of interest (ROI) surronding the locus, and the whole linkage group, for different exercises.",

    "text": "Variant calling\nA generic variant calling workflow consists of the following basic steps:\n\nread quality control and filtering\nread mapping\nremoval / marking of duplicate reads\njoint / sample-based variant calling and genotyping\n\nThere are different tweaks and additions to each of these steps, depending on application and method.\n1. Read quality control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Per base quality scores, read 1 (upper) and read 2 (lower panel), obtained from the FastQC program. Quality values are on the \\(y\\)-axis, base position in sequence read on \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n\nDNA sequencers score the quality of each sequenced base as phred quality scores, which is equivalent to the probability \\(P\\) that the call is incorrect. The base quality scores, denoted \\(Q\\), are defined as\n\\[\nQ = -10 \\log_{10} P\n\\]\nwhich for \\(P=0.01\\) gives \\(Q=20\\). Converting from quality to probability is done by solving for \\(P\\):\n\\[\nP = 10^{-Q/10}\n\\]\nHence, a base quality score \\(Q=20\\) (somtimes written Q20) corresponds to a 1% probability that the call is incorrect, Q30 a 0.1% probability, and so on, where the higher the quality score, the better. Bases with low quality scores are usually discarded from downstream analyses, but what is a good threshold? The human genome has approximately 1 SNP per 1,000 bp, which means sequencing errors will be ten times as probable in a single read for Q20 base calls. A reasonable threshold is therefore around Q20-Q30 for many purposes.\nThe base qualities typically drop towards the end of the reads (Figure 1). Prior to mapping it may therefore be prudent to remove reads that display too high drop in quality, too low mean quality, or on some other quality metric reported by the qc software.\nThe quality scores are encoded using ASCII codes. An example of a FASTQ sequence is given below. The code snippet shows an example of shell commands1 that are separated by a so-called pipe (|) character which takes the output from one process and sends it as input to the next2.\nNote that we use the long option names to clarify commands, and we aim to do so consistently when a new command is introduced. Once you feel confident you know what a command does, you will probably want to switch to short option names, and we may do so in the instructions for some commonly used commands (e.g., head -n) without warning. Remember to use --help to examine command options.\n\n# Command using long (-- prefix) option names\nzcat fastq/PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz | head --lines 4 | cut --characters -30\n# Equivalent command using short (single -, single character) option names\n# zcat fastq/PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz | head -n 4 | cut -c -30\n\n@SRR9309790.10003134\nTAAATCGATTCGTTTTTGCTATCTTCGTCT\n+\nAAFFFJJJJJJJFJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ\n\n\nConsequently, a FASTQ entry consists of four lines:\n\nsequence id (prefixed by @)\nDNA sequence\nseparator (+)\nphred base quality scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Use the command wc to determine how many sequences are in fastq/PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the --help option to show documentation for the wc command (wc --help). This will show that wc prints newline, word and byte counts for a file, where newline is what we’re after. We can restrict the output to newline characters with the --lines option. Use zcat to print the contents of fastq/PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz to the screen, piping (|) the output to wc --lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzcat fastq/PUN-Y-INJ_R1.fastq.gz | wc --lines\n\nSince there are four lines per sequence (id, sequence, + separator, qualities) you need to divide the final number by four (622744 / 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Read mapping\nRead mapping consists of aligning sequence reads, typically from individuals in a population (a.k.a. resequencing) to a reference sequence. The choice of read mapper depends, partly on preference, but mostly on the sequencing read length and application. For short reads, a common choice is bwa-mem, and for longer reads minimap2.\nIn what follows, we will assume that the sequencing protocol generates paired-end short reads (e.g., from Illumina). In practice, this means a DNA fragment has been sequenced from both ends, where fragment sizes have been selected such that reads do not overlap (i.e., there is unsequenced DNA between the reads of a given insert size).\nThe final output of read mapping is an alignment file in binary alignment map (BAM) format or variants thereof.\n3. Removal / marking of duplicate reads\nDuring sample preparation or DNA amplification with PCR, it may happen that a single DNA fragment is present in multiple copies and therefore produces redundant sequencing reads. This shows up as alignments with identical start and stop coordinates. These so-called duplicate reads should be marked prior to any downstream analyses. The most commonly used tools for this purpose are samtools markdup and picard MarkDuplicates.\n4. Variant calling and genotyping\nOnce BAM files have been produced, it is time for variant calling, which is the process of identifying sites where there sequence variation. There are many different variant callers, of which we will mention four.\nbcftools is a toolkit to process variant call files, but also has a variant caller command. We will use bcftools to look at and summarize the variant files.\nfreebayes uses a Bayesian model to call variants. It may be time-consuming in high-coverage regions, and one therefore may have to mask repetitive and other low-complexity regions.\nANGSD is optimized for low-coverage data. Genotypes aren’t called directly; rather, genotype likelihoods form the basis for all downstream analyses, such as calculation of diversity or other statistics.\nFinally, GATK HaplotypeCaller performs local realignment around variant candidates, which avoids the need to run the legacy GATK IndelRealigner. Realignment improves results but requires more time to run. GATK is optimized for human data. For instance, performance drops dramatically if the reference sequence consists of many short scaffolds/contigs, and there is a size limit to how large the chromosomes can be. It also requires some parameter optimization and has a fairly complicated workflow (Hansen, 2016).\nGATK best practice variant calling\nWe will base our work on the GATK Germline short variant discovery workflow. In addition to the steps outlined above, there is a step where quality scores are recalibrated in an attempt to correct errors produced by the base calling procedure itself.\nGATK comes with a large set of tools.

    "text": "Read mapping\nWe will start by mapping FASTQ read pairs to the reference. We will use the bwa read mapper together with samtools to process the resulting output.\nRead group information identifies sequence sets\nSome of the downstream processes require that reads have been assigned read groups (“Read Groups,” 2023), which is a compact string representation of a set of reads that originate from a sequencing unit and sample. Assigning read groups becomes particularly important for multiplexing protocols, or when a sample has been sequenced on different lanes or platform units, as it allows for the identification of sequence batch issues (e.g., poor sequence quality). Here, we want to assign a unique ID, the sample id (SM), and the sequencing platform (PL), where the latter informs the algorithms on what error model to apply. The read group is formatted as @RG\\tID:uniqueid\\tSM:sampleid\\tPU:platform, where \\t is the tab character. More fields can be added; see the SAM specification, section 1.3 (HTS Format Specifications, 2023) for a complete list.\nSample information is available in the sampleinfo.csv file:\n\nhead -n 3 sampleinfo.csv\n\nSample,Run,ScientificName,SampleName,AuthorSample,SampleAlias,Taxon,Latitude,Longitude,% Reads aligned,Seq. Depth\nSRS4979271,SRR9309782,Diplacus longiflorus,LON-T33_1,T33,LON-T33,ssp. longiflorus,34.3438,-118.5099,94.6,18.87\nSRS4979267,SRR9309785,Diplacus longiflorus,LON-T8_8,T8,LON-T8,ssp. longiflorus,34.1347,-118.6452,82.6,25.11\n\n\nThe sample information is a combination of the run information obtained from the SRA (BioProject PRJNA549183) and the sample sheet provided with the article. An additional column SampleAlias has been added that names samples using a three-letter abbreviation for population hyphenated with the sample identifier. For the ssp. puniceus, an additional one-letter character denoting the color ecotype is inserted between population and sample id. PUN-Y-BCRD then is a sample from the puniceus subspecies with the yellow ecotype. We will use the Run column as unique ID, SampleAlias as the sample id SM, and ILLUMINA as the platform PL.\nRead mapping with bwa and conversion to BAM format with samtools\nLet’s map the FASTQ files corresponding to sample PUN-Y-BCRD:\n\nbwa mem -R \"@RG\\tID:SRR9309788\\tSM:PUN-Y-BCRD\\tPL:ILLUMINA\" -t 4 \\\n    -M ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta \\\n    fastq/PUN-Y-BCRD_R1.fastq.gz \\\n    fastq/PUN-Y-BCRD_R2.fastq.gz | \\\n    samtools sort - | \\\n    samtools view --with-header --output bam/PUN-Y-BCRD.bam\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here. First, the -R flag to bwa mem passes the read group information to the mapper. -t sets the number of threads, and -M marks shorter split hits as secondary, which is for Picard compatibility1. The first positional argument is the reference sequence, followed by the FASTQ files for read 1 and 2, respectively.\nThe output would be printed on the screen (try running the bwa mem command alone!), but we pipe the output to samtools sort to sort the mappings (by default by coordinate). The - simply means “read from the pipe”.\nFinally, samtools view converts the text output to binary format (default), including the header information (short option -h). You can use the same command to view the resulting output on your screen:\n\nsamtools view bam/PUN-Y-BCRD.bam | head -n 2\n\nSRR9309788.7313829  129 LG4 29  60  103M2I46M   =   83824   83796   GTCAATTTCATGTTTGACTTTTAGATTTTTAATTAATTATATATTTTTTGCAATTTGTAACCTCTTTAACCTTTATTTAATTTTTTGAATTTCTTTTTTATTTTATTTTCAAATACAATTCACCCCAATTAATTATTTTAATTATAACAAT AAFFFJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJFJJJJJJJJJJJJJAFJJFJJJF&lt;JJJJJJJJ&lt;AJJJJJJJJJ-FFJJAJJJJA-7-7----&lt;A---7&lt;-)7AAA-AA7-&lt;-7--&lt;A---7---7 NM:i:6  MD:Z:107T25A1C6A6   MC:Z:88M8D63M   MQ:i:60 AS:i:121    XS:i:80 RG:Z:SRR9309788\nSRR9309788.9554822  99  LG4 58  60  74M2I75M    =   256 321 TAATTAATTATATATTTTTTGCAATTTGTAACCTCTTTAACCTTTATTTAATTTTTTGAATTTCTTTTTTATTTTATTTTCAAATACAATTCACCCCAATTAATTAATCTAATTAAAACAATTAAATAATCAACCCGAATGATTAACCAAT AAFFFJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJFAAJJJJJJJJFJJJFJJ&lt;FJJAJJJFJJJJ&lt; NM:i:5  MD:Z:78T54G0C14 MC:Z:21S82M2I9M5I32M    MQ:i:60 AS:i:126    XS:i:81 RG:Z:SRR9309788\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the header information of the output BAM file.

The @SQ tag corresponds to the reference sequence dictionary and tells you what region you are looking at (chromosome LG4, which has a length LN 100000 bases; the example reference sequence was created by extracting the region on LG4 from position 12000000 to 12100000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark duplicate reads with Picard MarkDuplicates\nOnce mapping is completed, we must find and mark duplicate reads as these can distort the results of downstream analyses, such as variant calling. We here use Picard MarkDuplicates.\nTo facilitate downstream processing, we will from now on make use of environment variables2 to refer to a sample and the reference sequence. Retrieve the SRR id from the sampleinfo file.\n\nexport SRR=SRR9309790\nexport SAMPLE=PUN-Y-INJ\nexport REF=ref/M_aurantiacus_v1.fasta\n\n\npicard MarkDuplicates --INPUT bam/${SAMPLE}.bam \\\n    --METRICS_FILE md/${SAMPLE}.dup_metrics.txt \\\n    --OUTPUT md/${SAMPLE}.bam\n\nThe metrics output file contains information on the rate of duplication. We will include the output in the final MultiQC report.\nAn additional mapping quality metric of interest is percentage mapped reads and average read depth. We can use qualimap bamqc to collect mapping statistics from a BAM file:\n\nqualimap bamqc -bam bam/${SAMPLE}.bam -outdir qualimap/${SAMPLE}_stats\n\nA summary of the results is exported to qualimap/${SAMPLE}_stats/genome_results.txt; we show percent mapping and average coverage below as examples:\n\ngrep \"number of mapped reads\" qualimap/${SAMPLE}_stats/genome_results.txt\ngrep \"mean coverageData\" qualimap/${SAMPLE}_stats/genome_results.txt\n\n     number of mapped reads = 7,643 (96.94%)\n     mean coverageData = 11.0246X",

    "text": "Now we turn our attention to a VCF file containing variant and invariant sites. We will generate depth-based filters, with the motivation that they represent portions of the genome that are accessible to analysis, regardless of whether they contain variants or not. In so doing, we treat filtered sites as missing data and do not assume that they are invariant, as many software packages do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Coverage distributions for three hypothetical samples along with the cumulative coverage for all samples.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the sequencing coverage of three samples. The important thing to note is that the coverage is uneven. Some regions lack coverage entirely, e.g., due to random sampling or errors in the reference sequence. Other regions have excessive coverage, which could be a sign of repeats that have been collapsed in the reference. A general coverage filter could then seek to mask out sites where a fraction (50%, say) of individuals have too low or excessive coverage.\nThe right panel illustrates the sum of coverages across all samples. Minimum and maximum depth filters could be applied to the aggregate coverages of all samples, or samples grouped by population, to eliminate sites confounding data support.\nAs mentioned, the VCF in this exercise contains all sites; that is, both monomorphic and polymorphic sites are present. Every site contains information about depth and other metadata, which makes it possible to apply coverage filters directly to the variant file itself.\nHowever, it may not always be possible to generate a VCF with all sites. Species with large genomes will produce files so large that they prevent efficient downstream processing. Under these circumstances, ad hoc coverage filters can be applied to the BAM files to in turn generate sequence masks that can be used in conjunction with the variant file. This is the topic for the advanced session.\nRegardless of approach, the end result is a set of regions that are discarded (masked) for a given analysis. They can be given either as a BED file, or a sequence mask, which is a FASTA-like file consisting of integer digits (between 0 and 9) for each position on a chromosome. Then, by setting a cutoff, an application can mask positions higher than that cutoff. We will generate mask files with 0 and 1 digits, an example of which is shown below, where the central 10 bases of the reference (top) are masked (bottom).\n\n\n&gt;LG4 LG4:12000001-12100000\nGGACAATTACCCCCTCCGTTATGTTTCAGT\n\n&gt;LG4\n000000000011111111110000000000\n\n\n\nWe start by summarising the raw data, as before.\n\nbcftools stats allsites.vcf.gz | grep ^SN\n\nSN  0   number of samples:  10\nSN  0   number of records:  100000\nSN  0   number of no-ALTs:  92291\nSN  0   number of SNPs: 3784\nSN  0   number of MNPs: 0\nSN  0   number of indels:   1149\nSN  0   number of others:   0\nSN  0   number of multiallelic sites:   489\nSN  0   number of multiallelic SNP sites:   57\n\n\n\nBy now you should be familiar with the vcftools commands to generate relevant data for filters. In particular, we used --site-depth to generate depth profiles over all sites, and --missing-site to generate missingness data, based on genotype presence/abscence, for every site.

    "text": "Now we turn our attention to a VCF file containing variant and invariant sites. We will generate depth-based filters, with the motivation that they represent portions of the genome that are accessible to analysis, regardless of whether they contain variants or not. In so doing, we treat filtered sites as missing data and do not assume that they are invariant, as many software packages do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Coverage distributions for three hypothetical samples along with the cumulative coverage for all samples.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the sequencing coverage of three samples. The important thing to note is that the coverage is uneven. Some regions lack coverage entirely, e.g., due to random sampling or errors in the reference sequence. Other regions have excessive coverage, which could be a sign of repeats that have been collapsed in the reference. A general coverage filter could then seek to mask out sites where a fraction (50%, say) of individuals have too low or excessive coverage.\nThe right panel illustrates the sum of coverages across all samples. Minimum and maximum depth filters could be applied to the aggregate coverages of all samples, or samples grouped by population, to eliminate sites confounding data support.\nAs mentioned, the VCF in this exercise contains all sites; that is, both monomorphic and polymorphic sites are present. Every site contains information about depth and other metadata, which makes it possible to apply coverage filters directly to the variant file itself.\nHowever, it may not always be possible to generate a VCF with all sites. Species with large genomes will produce files so large that they prevent efficient downstream processing. Under these circumstances, ad hoc coverage filters can be applied to the BAM files to in turn generate sequence masks that can be used in conjunction with the variant file. This is the topic for the advanced session.\nRegardless of approach, the end result is a set of regions that are discarded (masked) for a given analysis. They can be given either as a BED file, or a sequence mask, which is a FASTA-like file consisting of integer digits (between 0 and 9) for each position on a chromosome. Then, by setting a cutoff, an application can mask positions higher than that cutoff. We will generate mask files with 0 and 1 digits, an example of which is shown below, where the central 10 bases of the reference (top) are masked (bottom).\n\n\n&gt;LG4 LG4:12000001-12100000\nGGACAATTACCCCCTCCGTTATGTTTCAGT\n\n&gt;LG4\n000000000011111111110000000000\n\n\n\nWe start by summarising the raw data, as before.\n\nbcftools stats allsites.vcf.gz | grep ^SN\n\nSN  0   number of samples:  10\nSN  0   number of records:  100000\nSN  0   number of no-ALTs:  92291\nSN  0   number of SNPs: 3784\nSN  0   number of MNPs: 0\nSN  0   number of indels:   1149\nSN  0   number of others:   0\nSN  0   number of multiallelic sites:   489\nSN  0   number of multiallelic SNP sites:   57\n\n\n\nBy now you should be familiar with the vcftools commands to generate relevant data for filters.

    "text": "Linkage disequilibrium decay1\n\nGenetic markers in close proximity are often inherited together; we say that the markers are linked. Genetic linkage creates haplotypes and haplotype structures that contain information about inheritance patterns and evolutionary processes. Linkage can be thought of as a force that keeps markers together. Recombination, on the other hand, breaks down linkage and therefore acts as an opposing force that generates new haplotypes as new combinations of alleles. The farther apart two markers are, the more likely a recombination event between them is.\nThe distance between two markers is often measured as a genetic distance. It is measured in centiMorgan (cM), defined as the average number of crossovers (recombination events) per hundred between the markers. For instance, two markers 10cM apart is equivalent to 0.1 crossovers in meiosis on average. For short distances, this can be interpreted as the percent probability of crossover.\nThe genetic distance can be related to physical distance as expressed in base pair distance through the recombination rate, measured in cM/Mb. This metric can be interpreted as the probability of crossover per Mb. For instance, in human the recombination rate is 1.2cM/Mb on average, meaning there is a 1.2% probability of crossover per Mb.\nConsequently, for longer distances recombination tends to be the dominating force, whereas linkage is stronger for shorter distances. For humans, as a rule of thumb LD is stronger for SNPs ~0.01-0.1 cM apart, whereas recombination dominates linkage for distances &gt; ~0.1cM (Pritchard, n.d., Chapter 2.3). Exactly where the transition occurs depends on the strength of recombination. Figure 1 shows the theoretical breakdown of LD for different recombination rates. This is the type of plot that we will generate next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Linkage disequilibrium decay for different recombination rates (r)",

Necessary since model organisms often have annotated variant names\n\n--thin – randomly remove variants with probability p. You may need to tweak this variable to get the proper output (and reduce output size!)\n\n--r2-unphased – emulate plink --r2 option; calculate the squared correlation coefficient \\(r^2\\) for unphased data between markers. This is the output that is used for the plots below. The zs argument tells plink2 to compress output in zs format\n\n--ld-window – limit the number of variants between which r2 is calculated (NB: differs from plink!)\n\n--ld-window-kb – max distance in kb between markers for which r2 is calculated\n\n--mac – filter variants on minor allele count. Try out different settings for this parameter and note the difference in output.\n\n--geno – exclude variants with missing call frequencies greater than threshold\n\n--mind – exclude samples with missing call frequencies greater than threshold\n\n-ld-window-r2 – by default this sets a filter on the final output but we want to keep everything\n\n--make-bed – create the (old plink-style) binary output dataset\n\n--out – prefix for output data\n\n2&gt;&1 &gt; /dev/null – redirects errors and output to the electronic wastebin.

Choosing window size can be as simple as trying out different values, often ranging from single to several hundred kilobases. As always, the appropriate size depends on the analyses.\nOne rule of thumb that can be applied is that the window size should be larger than the genomic background of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Recall, LD is the non-random co-segregation of alleles at two or more loci. Linked loci will induce correlations in window-based statistics, so by choosing a window size larger than the LD background, we ensure that our windows are, in some sense, independent.\nFor this reason, a common approach is to calculate some measure of LD between marker pairs, and generate a plot of LD decay. This is outside the scope of this exercise, but the interested reader can consult the plink documentation for ways to do this. See also Figure 3 for an example plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Properties of genetic variation and inferred demographic history in sampled A. millepora. Fuller et al. (2020), Figure 2. Upper left plot illustrates LD as a function of physical distance. Here, choosing a window size 20-30kb would ensure that most windows are independent.\n\n\n\nEven though single point summary statistics can be informative, we can get an overview of the distribution over the chromosome by plotting:\n\ncsvtk plot line --tabs $OUT.windowed.pi -x BIN_START -y PI \\\n   --point-size 0.01 --xlab \"Position (bp)\" \\\n   --ylab \"Diversity\" --title LG4 --width 9.0 --height 3.5 \\\n   &gt; $OUT.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Nucleotide diversity across LG4 for all populations.\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the diversity for all populations. We would also be interested in comparing the diversity for different populations. This can be achieved by passing a population file to bcftools view and piping (|) the output to vcftools:\n\nbcftools view -S PAR.txt $VCF |\\\n vcftools --vcf - --window-pi 1000 --out $OUT.PAR 2&gt; /dev/null\nbcftools view -S ARI.txt $VCF |\\\n vcftools --vcf - --window-pi 1000 --out $OUT.ARI 2&gt; /dev/null\n\nWith some csvtk magic we can combine the measures and plot:\n\n# When assigning a constant must enclose it in single quotes within double quotes\ncsvtk mutate2 --tabs --name Population --expression \" 'ARI' \" \\\n   $OUT.ARI.windowed.pi &gt; $OUT.ARI.wpi\ncsvtk mutate2 --tabs --name Population --expression \" 'PAR' \" \\\n   $OUT.PAR.windowed.pi &gt; $OUT.PAR.wpi\ncsvtk concat --tabs $OUT.ARI.wpi $OUT.PAR.wpi |\\\n csvtk plot --tabs line - -x BIN_START -y PI \\\n    --group-field Population \\\n    --point-size 0.01 --xlab \"Position (bp)\" \\\n    --ylab \"Diversity\" --title \"LG4:PAR and ARI\" \\\n    --width 9.0 --height 3.5 \\\n    &gt; $OUT.ARI.PAR.png 2&gt;/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Nucleotide diversity across LG4 comparing populations ARI and PAR.\n\n\n\\(F_{ST}\\)\nSince \\(F_{ST}\\) is a statistic that compares populations, we must supply two or more of the population files we defined above. A population file name is passed to the --weir-fst-pop option. Calculations are done by site per default, but let’s calculate \\(F_{ST}\\) for a comparison of two populations in 100kb windows:\n\n# Set your window size higher, e.g., 100000\nvcftools --gzvcf $VCF --weir-fst-pop ARI.txt \\\n   --weir-fst-pop PAR.txt \\\n   --fst-window-size 1000 \\\n   --out $OUT.ARI-PAR\n\n\ncsvtk plot line --tabs $OUT.ARI-PAR.windowed.weir.fst \\\n   -x BIN_START -y MEAN_FST \\\n   --point-size 0.01 --xlab \"Position (bp)\" \\\n   --ylab \"Fst\" --title \"LG4:ARI vs PAR\" \\\n   --width 9.0 --height 3.5 \\\n   &gt; $OUT.ARI-PAR.windowed.weir.fst.mean.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Mean \\(F_{ST}\\) across LG4, comparing ARI and PAR populations.\n\n\nCompiling statistics with pixy\nThe vcftools statistics that we just calculated have a couple of issues:\n\nthey have been calculated on unfiltered data; this can be somewhat remediated by applying a depth-based filter\na more concerning problem is that even if we did apply a filter, all missing sites would be treated as invariant sites, when in reality the windows would need to be adjusted to the number of accessible sites within a window. This number could be calculated from a mask file, but adds some complexity to the calculations.\n\nInstead of applying filters, let’s first try out an alternative solution. pixy is a program that facilitates the calculation of nucleotide diversity within \\(\\pi\\) and between \\(d_{XY}\\) populations from a VCF, as well as differentiation (\\(F_{ST}\\)). It also takes invariant sites and missing data into consideration. Another nice feature is that by providing a population file with all samples, every population comparison is done on the fly, so only one run is needed!\nCalculating per-site statistics takes too long time, so we will only generate windowed output here. This may still take a couple of minutes though.\n\nmkdir -p 02-pixy\n# Set your window size higher, e.g., 100kb\npixy --stats pi fst dxy \\\n  --vcf $VCF \\\n  --populations populations.txt \\\n  --window_size 1000 \\\n  --output_folder 02-pixy \\\n  --n_cores 4\n\n\nhead -n 3 02-pixy/pixy_pi.txt\n\npop chromosome  window_pos_1    window_pos_2    avg_pi  no_sites    count_diffs count_comparisons   count_missing\nLON LG4 1   1000    0.0019674355495251  616 29  14740   3544\nPAR LG4 1   1000    0.0008201763379126  625 12  14631   3653\n\n\nFor windowed output, the pixy output files contain information on the windows, the number of missing sites, number of snps, and more. The first column corresponds to the population, which means we can easily select lines matching population(s) of interest. For a full description, consult the documentation. Note that because we provided a population file defining two populations, diversity is calculated per population.\nWe conclude by plotting diversity for ARI and PAR\n\n# Possibly remove NA values that otherwise would throw error\ncsvtk filter2 --tabs \\\n   --filter '$avg_pi != \"NA\" && ($pop == \"ARI\" || $pop == \"PAR\") ' \\\n   02-pixy/pixy_pi.txt | \\\n csvtk plot line --tabs - -x window_pos_1 -y avg_pi \\\n    --group-field pop \\\n    --point-size 0.01 --xlab \"Position (bp)\" \\\n    --ylab \"Diversity\" --title \"LG4:ARI and PAR\" \\\n --width 9.0 --height 3.5 \\\n    &gt; 02-pixy/pixy_pi.ARI-PAR.txt.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Mean diversity across LG4 for ARI and PAR.\n\n\nand \\(F_{ST}\\) comparing ARI and PAR\n\ncsvtk filter2 --tabs \\\n   --filter '$avg_wc_fst != \"NA\" && $pop1 == \"PAR\" && $pop2 == \"ARI\" ' \\\n   02-pixy/pixy_fst.txt | \\\n csvtk plot line -t - -x window_pos_1 -y avg_wc_fst \\\n    --point-size 0.01 --xlab \"Position (bp)\" \\\n    --ylab \"Fst\" --title \"LG4:ARI vs PAR\" --width 9.0 --height 3.5 \\\n    &gt; 02-pixy/pixy_fst.ARI-PAR.txt.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Mean \\(F_{ST}\\) across LG4 for ARI vs PAR.\n\n\nComparing Figure 8 to Figure 6 shows a stark contrast, so clearly, how you filter and handle invariant/missing data will strongly affect the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPTIONAL: Apply filters to pixy and vcftools output and compare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate depth filters, utilizing the knowledge from the variant filtering lab, and apply them to the VCF file. Rerun a couple of pixy and vcftools stats to see how it affects the outcome. Provided you use identical window sizes, you could make a scatter plot of a statistic of the two tools against oneanother.",
